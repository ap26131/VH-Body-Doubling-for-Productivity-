        <h4>Color Woahs </h4>
        
        <p> In the colorful world of Mrs. Bloom’s kindergarten classroom, there was a lively little box of crayons tucked away in the art corner. Every morning, the crayons would wiggle excitedly in their box, waiting for the moment the kids would open the lid and choose them to create art. Each crayon had its own personality, and every day was an adventure.

          “Today’s the day! I can feel it!” declared Ruby Red, the brightest crayon in the box.
          
          “You say that every day, Ruby,” said Buttercup Yellow with a yawn. “But today really *does* feel special. I’m ready to draw some sunshine!”
          
          “Or a lemon!” added Minty Green, bouncing with enthusiasm. “I hope I get picked for some grass today. I love making the world look fresh and green!”
          
          “You’re all so predictable,” Midnight Blue said with a sigh. “I just hope they don’t use me for the sky *again.* I want to be used for something mysterious, like a deep ocean or outer space.”
          
          The crayons were always filled with anticipation, wondering which of them would be chosen. At the end of the row, shy Lilac Purple whispered, “I hope someone uses me for something pretty... like a flower or a princess dress.”
          
          The chatter came to a halt when they heard the familiar sound of tiny footsteps approaching. The crayons held their breath as the box lid opened, and bright sunlight poured into their world. The eager faces of the kindergarteners peered down, eyes wide with excitement.
          
          “Here we go!” Ruby Red squealed. “This is it!”
          
          As the children’s hands reached into the box, there was a flurry of movement. The first crayon chosen was Sunshine Yellow, who let out a cheer. “Hooray! I knew today was my day!” Soon, she was busy drawing a bright sun in the corner of a big white sheet of paper.
          
          “Ah, I feel so alive!” Sunshine Yellow giggled as the paper scratched against her tip.
          
          Next, Minty Green was selected to draw grass and trees. “Oh, yes! I knew I’d get picked for nature today!” he exclaimed, rolling up his metaphorical sleeves and getting to work creating the most vibrant, fluffy trees he could manage.
          
          The crayons cheered each other on as one by one they were pulled from the box. Buttercup Yellow and Ruby Red joined forces to color in a flower. They were in the middle of arguing over whether the petals should have a red outline when a small hand grabbed Midnight Blue.
          
          “Finally, something different,” Midnight Blue muttered. But instead of being used to color the sky, he was drawn into the shape of a fierce dragon breathing fire. Midnight Blue's spirits lifted as he realized he was finally being used for something adventurous.
          
          “I’m a dragon!” he shouted, delighted. “This is amazing! I’m fierce and powerful!”
          
          Meanwhile, shy Lilac Purple watched from the bottom of the box. No one had picked her yet. She always worried that she wasn’t as bright or as bold as the other crayons. Who wanted to use a soft purple when there were so many dazzling colors to choose from?
          
          “Don’t worry, Lilac,” said Ruby Red. “Your time will come.”
          
          “Yeah, the kids love purple,” Minty Green added. “They just haven’t gotten to you yet.”
          
          But Lilac Purple wasn’t so sure. She sighed softly and settled back into her corner of the box, hoping that maybe, just maybe, today would be different.
          
          As the classroom art project went on, the kids began to chatter with excitement. “Let’s draw a unicorn!” one of the girls exclaimed. The others cheered in agreement.
          
          Lilac Purple’s heart skipped a beat. Unicorns were beautiful, magical creatures. Maybe—just maybe—she would be chosen!
          
          But instead, the children reached for Ruby Red, Buttercup Yellow, and Cotton Candy Pink. The unicorn’s mane was colorful and vibrant, but there was no purple in sight.
          
          Lilac Purple’s tip drooped. “I guess no one needs me today, either,” she whispered to herself.
          
          Just then, one of the younger children named Mia reached into the crayon box with chubby fingers. “I want this one!” she said, pulling Lilac Purple out of the box.
          
          “Wait—what’s happening?” Lilac Purple gasped. She had never been picked before! As Mia brought her to the paper, Lilac’s soft lavender color touched the page for the first time.
          
          Mia was gentle as she drew. The unicorn needed a magical aura, and Lilac Purple was perfect for the job. Lilac Purple’s soft, dreamy color swirled around the unicorn, creating a shimmering glow that made the other crayons ooh and ahh.
          
          “Oh wow,” Midnight Blue said with admiration. “I would never have thought to use purple like that.”
          
          “Look at you go, Lilac!” cheered Buttercup Yellow. “That unicorn looks amazing!”
          
          Lilac Purple’s heart swelled with joy as she saw the beautiful artwork she was helping to create. She realized she was making the picture magical in a way no other crayon could.
          
          “Maybe being soft and gentle isn’t so bad after all,” Lilac Purple thought, feeling her confidence bloom.
          
          As the children finished their artwork, the crayons were carefully put back in their box. They were all a bit shorter, a bit worn, but brimming with excitement over how they had spent their day.
          
          “Great job today, everyone!” Ruby Red said. “We made some beautiful art.”
          
          Midnight Blue, still feeling proud of his dragon, nodded. “Yes, and it was good to finally do something other than sky.”
          
          “But you were the real star today, Lilac,” said Minty Green, patting her gently. “That unicorn’s aura was stunning.”
          
          Lilac Purple beamed. “Thanks, everyone. I guess it’s true—every color has its moment to shine.”
          
          Just as the crayons settled down to rest, they heard Mrs. Bloom say, “Tomorrow, we’re going to draw the ocean!” Midnight Blue let out a groan, but deep down, he was already looking forward to it.
          
          “Another day, another adventure,” Ruby Red whispered as the crayon box was closed for the night.
          
          And as the lights in the classroom dimmed, the crayons dreamed of the masterpieces they would help create next, knowing that each new day would bring a new opportunity to show the world their colors.
