# A Virtual Human Prototype for ADHD Support

## Project Description
A Virtual Human (VH) prototype is being developed to assist individuals with ADHD in task completion by improving focus and productivity. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a VH compared to a real human guide, analyzing the impact on user attention and task performance. The prototype integrates an advanced eye-tracking module with an AI-driven behavioral analysis system. By continuously monitoring user engagement, the system is designed to detect unproductive behaviors in real-time and provide personalized prompts and guidance to help refocus attention and maintain productivity.
